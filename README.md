# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles for PDE (Personal Development Environment) and also my Linux WM AwesomeWM.

The repo has a slightly unusual folder structure as I use `gnu stow` to manage symlinking my dotfiles.

## Tools

- nvim
- zellij
- fzf
- bat
- eza
- zoxide
- zsh
- ohmyzsh
- starship
- alacritty
